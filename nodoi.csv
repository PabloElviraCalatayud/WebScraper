We analyzed 94 Legionella pneumophila strains isolated from patients and the public bath facility using molecular typing methods, including Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis, sequence-based typing, multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis, and Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS). Genotypes obtained using these molecular epidemiological typing methods were highly correlated with each other. L. pneumophila strains of various genotypes were isolated from the public bath facility, of which only ST2398 and ST2399 were isolated from patients. ST2398 and ST2399, isolated from patients, bath water, and swabs, derived from one common circulating system at the bath facility out of seven were found to be novel genotypes and a highly clonal genetic lineage by single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis based on WGS. The result of haplotype network analysis based on SNVs showed that ST2398 and ST2399 differed only approximately 30-42 SNVs, and some environmental strains that differed by only 0-3 SNVs from patient strains were isolated. These results demonstrated that this outbreak was caused by L. pneumophila assigned to the ST2398 and ST2399 clades. We found that at least three patients were co-infected with different clusters of L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Our results show that several strains must be isolated from a single sample to consider the accumulation of mutations in water and co-infection when investigating outbreaks.

"PubMed","Molecular epidemiology of Brucella abortus in Shandong, China: high-resolution insights from combined MLVA-16 and core genome SNP analysis.","Chanjuan Huangfu; Xiujun Ma; Junjie Fan; Kuo Han; Ti Liu; Zengqiang Kou; Yan Li","The recent identification of Brucella abortus in human clinical samples from Shandong, China, highlights an ongoing zoonotic threat. We characterized 12 B. abortus strains isolated from human patients since 2021 using a combination of conventional biotyping, Multiple Locus Variable-number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA), and core-genome SNP (cgSNP) analysis. Epidemiological data indicated that infections primarily occurred in middle-aged men with occupational livestock exposure. Molecular typing revealed biovar 3 as the predominant type (91.7%), dominated by MLVA-8 genotype 36 and its corresponding MLVA-11 genotype 72 (66.7%). MLVA-16 distinguished 12 unique genotypes. The phylogeny based on cgSNP classified the strains into clades C1 (11 bv. 3 strains) and C2 (one bv. 1 strain). Within clade C1, nine strains in subclade C1-III exhibited ≤119 SNP differences, eight of which formed a local clonal transmission chain (≤52 SNPs) and shared MLVA-11 genotype 72. Subclade C1-I contained two strains with novel genotypes resulting from variations at the Bruce18 and Bruce43 loci. The sole C2 strain differed by only 3 SNPs from the A19 vaccine strain, suggesting a potential vaccine-related origin. Genetic links were also identified with strains from other Chinese provinces, among them Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, as well as from several countries, including Mongolia and Russia. These findings revealed a complex epidemiological pattern in Shandong, primarily characterized by local transmission chains with occasional external introductions, provided a scientific basis for targeted brucellosis control strategies.

Rapid genomic comparison helps guide timely infection control measures. This study aimed to develop a simple and rapid multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) protocol for epidemiological surveillance of E. hormaechei. Eight variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) regions were selected for amplification using multiplex PCR, followed by gel electrophoresis. The method's discriminatory power was evaluated on 46 unrelated strains from 22 French hospitals. Then, suspected related strains from three potential outbreaks, including ESBL- and/or NDM-producing isolates were compared. An independent collection of 22 VIM-producing strains was also analyzed. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used as the gold standard. Among 46 unrelated E. hormaechei strains, representing the five subspecies, MLVA and MLST showed similar discriminatory power (36 MLVA profiles vs. 33 STs, Hunter and Gaston diversity indices 0.9833 vs. 0.9824, respectively). Isolates with different ST typically had distinct MLVA profiles, except for three instances where different STs shared similar profiles. In STs represented by multiple strains, MLVA sometimes distinguished strains sharing the same ST. Among the three potential outbreak, epidemic strains exhibited unique MLVA profiles, with genetic distances of 0-11 SNPs using WGS, while unrelated isolates had different MLVA profiles, indicating this technique's potential as an effective screening tool for clonal groups. Similar results were observed for VIM-producing E. hormaechei, with consistent MLVA profiles within the same STs. The MLVA protocol developed is a rapid, cost-effective method for E. hormaechei epidemiological investigations that can quickly rule out unrelated strains. However, highly discriminatory techniques like WGS remain necessary when profiles are similar. ","10.1002/mbo3.70141"

Despite its significance, few studies have focused on determining C. burnetii genotypes in Iran. This study aimed to assess the genetic diversity of C. burnetii in Iran using the Multiple-Locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) method. A total of 26 C. burnetii-positive specimens were selected from a repository of 119 specimens collected from various locations across Iran. These samples were previously identified as C. burnetii using nested PCR and TaqMan real-time PCR techniques. In this study, the MLVA method was utilized for genotyping C. burnetii isolates. Genotyping results from the 26 C. burnetii-positive samples indicated that nearly all loci were informative for genotyping, except two loci (ms23 and ms26). Cluster analysis of the MLVA profiles identified 13 clusters, along with 40 singleton genotypes. Iranian isolates were distributed across a single cluster (Cluster 13), which consisted exclusively of Iranian strains, and 24 unique singleton genotypes, highlighting the genetic diversity of C. burnetii circulating within the region. The genotypic characteristics of C. burnetii observed in Iran differed significantly from those found in other global regions, suggesting unique local adaptations of this microorganism. To enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of Q fever in Iran, further large-scale studies are required to evaluate the distribution of C. burnetii genotypes across various geographic areas, host species, and environmental reservoirs.

However, a global perspective on the implications of the genetic diversity of this pathogen is lacking. This study aimed to determine and to analyze the genetic structure of M. hyopneumoniae based on the p97R1-p146R3 MLVA typing scheme and to characterize, analyze and compare MLVA types among countries where the information was publicly available. A set of 797 publicly available data of M. hyopneumoniae p97R1-p146R3 MLVA genetic types from six different countries were analyzed using Genalex 6.41 software to characterize loci polymorphism and using Structure 2.3.4 software in order to identify the genetic structure. A total of 185 MLVA types were identified among the analyzed data. For the p97R1 and p146R3 loci, most of the molecular variation in M. hyopneumoniae populations was identified within countries. Three genetic clusters and their recombinations were identified globally. M. hyopneumoniae is a genetically diverse pathogen with limited clonality and three well-defined clusters and their combinations were identified in this investigation.

"PubMed","On the ability to extract MLVA profiles of Vibrio cholerae isolates from WGS data generated with Oxford Nanopore Technologies.","Jérôme Ambroise; Bertrand Bearzatto; Jean-Francois Durant; Leonid M Irenge; Jean-Luc Gala","Multiple-Locus Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) Analysis (MLVA) is widely used to subtype pathogens causing foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks. The MLVAType shiny application was previously designed to extract MLVA profiles of Vibrio cholerae isolates from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, and provide backward compatibility with traditional MLVA typing methods. The previous development and validation work was conducted using short (pair-end 300 and 150 nt long) reads from Illumina MiSeq and Hiseq sequencing. In this study, the MLVAType application was validated using long reads generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms. In silico MLVA profiles of V. cholerae isolates (n = 9) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo were generated using the MLVAType application on Nanopore WGS data. The WGS-derived in silico MLVA profiles were extracted from Canu (v.2.2) assemblies obtained through MinION and GridION sequencing by ONT. The results were compared to those obtained from SPAdes assemblies (v3.13.0; k-mer 175) generated from short-read (pair-end 300-bp) reference data obtained by MiSeq sequencing, Illumina. For each isolate, the in silico MLVA profiles were concordant across all three sequencing methods, demonstrating that the MLVAType application can accurately predict the MLVA profiles from assembled genomes generated by long-reads ONT sequencers.

"PubMed","In silico MLVA Analysis of Brucella melitensis from Human and Livestock in Iran.","Maryam Dadar; Saeed Alamian","Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease caused by Brucella spp. globally, is of great significance not only to livestock but also to public health. The most significant of the twelve species is Brucella melitensis. This article is devoted to the endemic region of Iran and aims to uncover the molecular epidemiology of B. melitensis. Biotyping, AMOS-PCR, Bruce-ladder PCR, and the in silico method of MLVA were employed to test 40 B. melitensis isolates from humans, cows, sheep, goats, camels, and horses which are found in thirteen Iranian provinces throughout the years 2015 to 2022. The data from the MLVA-8 analysis showed that there were seven genotypes that could be identified, and the most commonly identified genotype was genotype 63. The data from the MLVA-10 analysis showed that there were seven genotypes, with genotype 213 being the most prevalent in Iran. The data from the MLVA-11 analysis showed that there were eight genotypes, with genotype 111 being the most prevalent in Iran. The MLVA and SNP analysis results showed that the bacteria were grouped into two main groups, known as the Eastern Mediterranean and American groups. Moreover, the outcomes from these analyses have added considerably to our understanding of the genetic/historical relationships among the isolates. Our study indicates a high prevalence of B. melitensis biovar 1 in Iran, accounting for 82.5% of the isolates. The study provides insight into such matters as the complex epidemiology of B. melitensis in Iran, suggesting different ways of transmission and sources of infection. This research points out the vital significance of the continuation of the surveillance and curation of B. melitensis in the diverse species of animals and humans. The simplicity and efficiency of MLVA-based molecular epidemiology offer information on the geographic distribution and genetic diversity of B. melitensis and, therefore, help in the devising of targeted strategies for the prevention of disease in animals.

"PubMed","Unravelling Chlamydia trachomatis diversity in Amhara, Ethiopia: MLVA-ompA sequencing as a molecular typing tool for trachoma.","Anna J Harte; Ehsan Ghasemian; Harry Pickering; Joanna Houghton; Ambahun Chernet; Eshetu Sata; Gizachew Yismaw; Taye Zeru; Zerihun Tadesse; E Kelly Callahan; Scott D Nash; Martin J Holland","Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide and is now largely confined to around 40 low- and middle-income countries. It is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a contagious intracellular bacterium. The World Health Organization recommends mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin for treatment and control of ocular Ct infections, alongside improving facial cleanliness and environmental conditions to reduce transmission. To understand the molecular epidemiology of trachoma, especially in the context of MDA and transmission dynamics, the identification of Ct genotypes could be useful. While many studies have used the Ct major outer membrane protein gene (ompA) for genotyping, it has limitations. Our study applies a typing system novel to trachoma, Multiple Loci Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis combined with ompA (MLVA-ompA). Ocular swabs were collected post-MDA from four trachoma-endemic zones in Ethiopia between 2011-2017. DNA from 300 children with high Ct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) loads was typed using MLVA-ompA, utilizing 3 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci within the Ct genome. Results show that MLVA-ompA exhibited high discriminatory power (0.981) surpassing the recommended threshold for epidemiological studies. We identified 87 MLVA-ompA variants across 26 districts. No significant associations were found between variants and clinical signs or chlamydial load. Notably, overall Ct diversity significantly decreased after additional MDA rounds, with a higher proportion of serovar A post-MDA. Despite challenges in sequencing one VNTR locus (CT1299), MLVA-ompA demonstrated cost-effectiveness and efficiency relative to whole genome sequencing, providing valuable information for trachoma control programs on local epidemiology. The findings suggest the potential of MLVA-ompA as a reliable tool for typing ocular Ct and understanding transmission dynamics, aiding in the development of targeted interventions for trachoma control.

"PubMed","Application of a new multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) scheme for the seasonal investigation of Cryptosporidium parvum cases in Wales and the northwest of England, spring 2022.","Harriet Risby; Guy Robinson; Nastassya Chandra; Grace King; Roberto Vivancos; Robert Smith; Daniel Thomas; Andrew Fox; Noel McCarthy; Rachel M Chalmers","The protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum is an important cause of gastroenteritis in humans and livestock, and cryptosporidiosis outbreaks are common. However, a multi-locus genotyping scheme is not widely adopted. We describe the further development and application of a seven-locus multi-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) scheme. From 28th March to 31st July 2022, confirmed C. parvum stools (n = 213) from cryptosporidiosis patients (cases) in Wales (n = 95) and the north west of England (n = 118) were tested by MLVA. Typability (defined as alleles identified at all seven loci in a sample) was 81.2% and discriminatory power estimated by Hunter Gaston Discriminatory Index was 0.99. A MLVA profile was constructed from the alleles, expressed in chromosomal order. Profiles were defined as simple (single allele at each locus) or mixed (more than one allele at any locus). A total of 161 MLVA profiles were identified; 13 were mixed, an additional 38 simple profiles contained null records, and 110 were complete simple profiles. A minimum spanning tree was constructed of simple MLVA profiles and those identical at all seven loci defined genetic clusters of cases (here, null records were considered as an allele); 77 cases formed 25 clusters, ranging from two to nine (mode = two) cases. The largest cluster, following epidemiological investigation, signalled a newly-identified outbreak. Two other cases with mixed profiles that contained the outbreak alleles were included in the outbreak investigation. In another epidemiologically-identified outbreak of six initial cases, MLVA detected two additional cases. In a third, small outbreak of three cases, identical MLVA profiles strengthened the microbiological evidence. Review of the performance characteristics of the individual loci and of the seven-locus scheme suggested that two loci might be candidates for review, but a larger dataset over a wider geographical area and longer timeframe will help inform decision-making about the scheme by user laboratories and stakeholders (such as public health agencies). This MLVA scheme is straightforward in use, fast and cheap compared to sequence-based methods, identifies mixed infections, provides an important tool for C. parvum surveillance, and can enhance outbreak investigations and public health action.

"PubMed","Validating the Utility of Multilocus Variable Number Tandem-repeat Analysis (MLVA) as a Subtyping Strategy to Monitor Listeria monocytogenes In-built Food Processing Environments.","Nicholas Andrews; Evonne McCabe; Patrick Wall; James F Buckley; Séamus Fanning","Listeria monocytogenes is a serious human pathogen and an enduring challenge to control for the ready-to-eat food processing industry. Cost-effective tools that can be deployed by commercial or in-house laboratories to rapidly investigate and resolve contamination events in the built food processing environment are of value to the food industry. Multilocus variable number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) is a molecular subtyping method, which along with other same-generation methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is being superseded in disease tracking and outbreak investigations by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In this paper, it is demonstrated that MLVA can continue to play a valuable role as a valid, fast, simple, and cost-effective method to identify and track Listeria monocytogenes subtypes in factory environments, with the method being highly congruent with MLST. Although MLVA does not have the discriminatory power of WGS to identify truly persistent clones, with careful interpretation of results alongside isolate metadata, it remains a powerful tool in situations and locations where WGS may not be readily available to food business operators.

Populations studies have been performed at local and national scales revealing a geographical genetic structure with temporal variations. A global epidemiology analysis of its causal agent Xanthomonas phaseoli pv. manihotis (Xpm) is needed to better understand the expansion of the disease for improving the monitoring of CBB. We targeted new tandem repeat (TR) loci with large repeat units, i.e. minisatellites, that we multiplexed in a scheme of Multi-Locus Variable number of TR Analysis (MLVA-8). This genotyping scheme separated 31 multilocus haplotypes in three clusters of single-locus variants and a singleton within a worldwide collection of 93 Xpm strains isolated over a period of fifty years. The major MLVA-8 cluster 1 grouped strains originating from all countries, except the unique Chinese strain. On the contrary, all the Xpm strains genotyped using the previously developed MLVA-14 microsatellite scheme were separated as unique haplotypes. We further propose an MLVA-12 scheme which takes advantage of combining TR loci with different mutation rates: the eight minisatellites and four faster evolving microsatellite markers, for global epidemiological surveillance. This MLVA-12 scheme identified 78 haplotypes and separated most of the strains in groups of double-locus variants (DLV) supporting some phylogenetic relationships. DLV groups were subdivided into closely related clusters of strains most often sharing the same geographical origin and isolated over a short period, supporting epidemiological relationships. The main MLVA-12 DLV group#1 was composed by strains from South America and all the African strains. The MLVA-12 scheme combining both minisatellite and microsatellite loci with different discriminatory power is expected to increase the accuracy of the phylogenetic signal and to minimize the homoplasy effects. Further investigation of the global epidemiology of Xpm will be helpful for a better control of CBB worldwide. ","10.1371/journal.pone.0285491"

Owing to the scarce information on this pathogen, here we addressed the genetic diversity of the circulating strains of this species in Argentina by following an MVLA_13 Bc scheme. The analyzed sample set consisted of 101 strains of B. canis isolates collected between 2006 and 2020 from canines of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA) and other regions of Argentina, as well as 235 isolates from North America. The analysis yielded 336 variants (Hunter-Gaston Diversity Index, HGDI equal to 1.0) showing high diversity on a global scale. The analysis of the six most variable markers also reveled high diversity and allowed further analysis regarding variant relationships. Although the diversity obtained using both schemes (all or the 6 most variable markers) was higher for the Latin American than for the North American strains, we cannot discard that this was due to biases in the sampling methodology or to the different health policies employed in these regions regarding the management of infected individuals. Altogether, the Argentine circulating strains are genetically diverse, but with no apparent geographical association. The markers used in the MLVA_13 Bc are variable and highly useful for the evaluation of outbreaks. Furthermore, the reduced panel of 6 markers (MLVA_6 Bc) proposed in this study is convenient for the study of B. canis strain diversity. ","10.1016/j.actatropica.2023.106914"

MLVA distributed 76% of the isolates across three major clonal complexes (CC1, CC2 and CC3), with the remaining forming minor clusters and singletons. While 90% of the salmon isolates belong to either CC1, CC2 or CC3, only 20% of the isolates recovered from other fish species do so, indicating a considerable degree of host specificity. We further highlight a series of 'clonal shifts' amongst Norwegian salmon isolates over the 35-year sampling period, with CC1 showing exclusive predominance prior to the emergence of CC2, which was later supplanted by CC3, before the recent re-emergence of CC1. Apparently, these shifts have rapidly swept the entire Norwegian coastline and conceivably, as suggested by typing of a small number of non-Norwegian isolates, the Northeast Atlantic region as a whole.

In conclusion, both goats and sheep in Great Britain (from 2014 onward) were found to carry the same MLVA genotypes (MST33-like; GG II) that were linked to a human Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands. This knowledge in combination with the usage of genotyping/genomotyping methods should prove useful in future surveillance programs and in the management of outbreaks.

In this study, 136 Egyptian Brucella melitensis strains isolated from animals and humans between 2001 and 2020 were analysed by examining the whole-core-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (cgSNP) in comparison to the in silico multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA-16). Almost all Egyptian isolates were belonging to the West Mediterranean clade, except two isolates from buffalo and camel were belonging to the American and East Mediterranean clades, respectively. A significant correlation between the human case of brucellosis and the possible source of infection from animals was found. It seems that several outbreak strains already existing for many years have been spread over long distances and between many governorates. The cgSNP analysis, in combination with epidemiological metadata, allows a better differentiation than the MLVA-16 genotyping method and, hence, the source definition and tracking of outbreak strains. The MLVA based on the currently used 16 markers is not suitable for this task. Our results revealed 99 different cgSNP genotypes with many different outbreak strains, both older and widely distributed ones and rather newly introduced ones as well. This indicates several different incidents and sources of infections, probably by imported animals from other countries to Egypt. Comparing our panel of isolates to public databases by cgSNP analysis, the results revealed near relatives from Italy. Moreover, near relatives from the United States, France, Austria and India were found by in silico MLVA. ","10.1111/tbed.14768"

Our aim was to genotype 50 B. melitensis strains isolated from sheep, goat, and cattle abortion samples from different farms in seven geographical regions of Turkey between 2009 and 2017. Forty-six different genotypes were detected in 50 isolates studied according to the MLVA-16. Thirty out of 50 isolate profiles matched profiles from the database exactly, and the remaining 20 were absent. Of these 30 isolates, 93.3% were identical to human isolates previously present in the database. All B. melitensis strains belonged to the eastern Mediterranean group. Genotype 43 was the most common isolate profile, and sequence typing (ST8) was dominant and detected in 39 strains. MLST analysis revealed a novel profile in 11 strains. On comparing the sequences of ST8 and the novel ST, a glucokinase gene variation was detected. In the MLST and MLVA analyses, no distinction was made between B. melitensis biovars. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the strains based on host, region, and year. Consequently, the discrimination power of MLVA was higher than that of MLST in this study. Contrastingly, MLST was useful in distinguishing strains according to geographic origins, as determined by performer studies. Profiles determined by MLVA were the same as those in humans. This raises concerns in regard to One Health and transition between hosts, as it is clear that protecting animal health is very important for human health. ","10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.109423"

Both cgSNP analysis and MLVA revealed three clusters and one isolate only was distantly related to the others. One cluster identified a rather widely distributed outbreak strain which is repeatedly occurring for at least 16 years with marginal deviations in cgSNP analysis. The other cluster of isolates represents a rather newly introduced outbreak strain. A separate cluster comprised RB51 vaccine related strains, isolated from aborted material. The comparison with MLVA data sets from public databases reveals one near relative from Argentina to the oldest outbreak strain and a related strain from Spain to a newly introduced outbreak strain in Egypt. The distantly related isolate matches with a strain from Portugal in the MLVA profile. Based on cgSNP analysis the oldest outbreak strain clusters with strains from the UK. Compared to the in silico analysis of MLVA, cgSNP analysis using WGS data provides a much higher resolution of genotypes and, when correlated to the associated epidemiological metadata, cgSNP analysis allows the differentiation of outbreaks by defining different outbreak strains. In this respect, MLVA data are error-prone and can lead to incorrect interpretations of outbreak events. ","10.3390/microorganisms9091942"

Moreover, conventional biotyping, B. abortus-melitensis-ovis-suis polymerase chain reaction (AMOS-PCR), and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) was applied to characterize the isolated strains. A total of 8103 (4.50%) samples were positive in RBPT, while 7705 (4.28%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.19-4.37) samples were positive in SAT. There was a significant difference in seroprevalence for human brucellosis over time, in different areas and different cities (districts) (χ2 = 2 = 32.23, 1984.14, and 3749.51, p < .05). The highest seropositivity (8.22% (4, 965/60393; 95% CI 8.00-8.44) was observed in Yulin City, which borders Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Gansu Province, China, regions that have a high incidence of human brucellosis.

After random selection, 132 B. melitensis were further genotyped using MLVA-16. The 132 strains were sorted into 100 MLVA-16 genotypes (GTs) (GT 1-100), 81 of which were single GTs represented by singular independent strains. The remaining 19 shared GTs involved 51 strains, and each GT included two to seven isolates from the Shaan northern and Guanzhong areas. These data indicated that although sporadic cases were a dominant epidemic characteristic of human brucellosis in this province, more than 38.6% (51/132) outbreaks were also found in the Shaan northern area and Guanzhong areas. The 47 shared MLVA-16 GTs were observed in strains (n = 71) from this study and strains (n = 337) from 19 other provinces of China. These data suggest that strains from the northern provinces are a potential source of human brucellosis cases in Shaanxi Province.

Multiplex PCR (mPCR) for genes encoding GDH (gluD), toxins A (tcdA)/ B (tcdB), 16S rDNA and binary toxin genes (ctdA and ctdB) was performed. The antibiotic susceptibility profile was determined by E-test. The A, B and binary toxins encoding genes were detected in all 29 C. difficile strains which were sensitive to metronidazole, vancomycin and were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, and moxifloxacin; resistance to imipenem demonstrated 97%, to rifampicin - 45% isolates. C. difficile strains could be grouped by MLVA into 5 distinct clusters, and the largest cluster II contains 16 strains. The comparison of rifampicin GM MIC of cluster II (n=16 strains) with all others (n=13) showed that strains from clusters I, III, IV and V possessed significantly (p <0.005) higher GM MIC and were more resistant to rifampicin. MLVA analysis proved transmission and recognized outbreak due to multidrug-resistant RT 027 C. difficile among patients of tertiary care hospital in Southern Poland. The reason for this is probably the widespread occurrence of spores in the hospital environment, which includes, among others, neglect of hygienic procedures and epidemic supervision. High resistance to imipenem (97%) and to rifampicin (45%) among C. difficile RT 027 Silesian isolates is threatening and requires further studies to elucidate this phenomenon. ","10.2147/IDR.S324745"

C. trachomatis genotypes can be discriminated by outer membrane protein A gene (ompA) sequencing, however this method has limited resolution. This study employed a high-resolution genotyping method, namely, multi-locus tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis with ompA sequencing (MLVA-ompA), to assess the distribution of LGV MLVA-ompA genotypes amongst individuals attending genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in London. Clinical specimens were collected from individuals attending eight London-based GUM clinics. Specimens that tested positive for C. trachomatis by commercial nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were confirmed as LGV by pmpH real-time PCR. LGV-positive DNA extracts were subsequently genotyped using MLVA-ompA. Two hundred and thirty DNA extracts were confirmed as LGV, and 162 (70%) yielded complete MLVA-ompA genotypes.

Legionella, mostly L. pneumophila, are responsible for LD, a severe, community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia. To date, no extensive assessment of Legionella spp and L. pneumophila using cultivation in combination with molecular approaches in the West Bank has been published. Two years of environmental surveillance of Legionella in water and biofilms in the drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) of eight hospitals was carried out; 180 L. pneumophila strains were isolated, mostly from biofilms in DWDS. Most of the isolates were identified as serogroup (Sg) 1 (60%) and 6 (30%), while a minor fraction comprised Sg 8 and 10. Multilocus Variable number of tandem repeats Analysis using 13 loci (MLVA-8(12)) was applied as a high-resolution genotyping method and compared to the standard Sequence Based Typing (SBT). The isolates were genotyped in 27 MLVA-8(12) genotypes (Gt), comprising four MLVA clonal complexes (VACC 1; 2; 5; 11). The major fraction of isolates constituted Sequence Type (ST)1 and ST461. Most of the MLVA-genotypes were highly diverse and often unique. The MLVA-genotype composition showed substantial regional variability. In general, the applied MLVA-method made it possible to reproducibly genotype the isolates, and was consistent with SBT but showed a higher resolution. The advantage of the higher resolution was most evident for the subdivision of the large strain sets of ST1 and ST461; these STs were shown to be highly pneumonia-relevant in a former study. This shows that the resolution by MLVA is advantageous for back-tracking risk sites and for the avoidance of outbreaks of L. pneumophila.

Egyptian B. abortus strains isolated from cattle share the same genotype with strains from Portugal and similar to strains from Italy with low genetic diversity. Strains with similar MLVA patterns isolated from different governorates highlight the movement of the pathogen among governorates. Hence, it may also reflect the long endemicity of brucellosis in Egypt with earlier dispersal of types and great local genetic diversity. Open markets may contribute to cross-species transmission and dissemination of the new types nationwide. The presence of West Mediterranean lineages of B. melitensis and relatedness of B. abortus strains from the studied countries is a result of the socio-historical connections among the Mediterranean countries.

Clonal assignment of strains was performed in the National Reference Laboratory for Streptococcal Infections (NRL) by the routinely used method, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and a newly introduced method, multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). The study strains were 87 isolates of S. pneumoniae selected from those referred to the NRL within the IPD surveillance programme from all over the CR in 2017. The study set covers S. pneumoniae isolates of both pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine serotypes (1, 4, and 9V) and non-vaccine serotypes (8, 9N, and 22F) widely spread in the CR. The study methods were MLST, the standard method used worldwide for the characterisation of pneumococcal isolates based on sequencing of a set of gene regions, and MLVA, which allows to characterise isolates based on the number of tandem repeats in intergenic regions. MLST revealed and confirmed a high level of clonal homogeneity of S. pneumoniae isolates of serotypes 1, 9N, 9V, and 22F and a considerable genetic variability of serotype 4 and 8 isolates. There was a general correlation between the MLST and MLVA clonal complex assignments. In comparison with MLST, MLVA has superior clonal discriminatory power. Isolates with the newly determined MLVA profiles should be assigned to new MLVA types (MT). Nevertheless, the new web support of the MLVA scheme for S. pneumoniae is less relevant as it does not provide services comparable to those available from the web support for MLST characterisation. MLST continues to be the standard method for clonal characterisation of S. pneumoniae isolates from IPD for the purposes of both national and international surveillance. MLST characteristics of isolates are helpful in the study of clonal variability conducted by both national and transnational public health protection authorities. MLVA is not routinely used but can serve as a complementary method for rapid identification of clonal relatedness between isolates, e.g. those from local outbreaks. It is more suitable for the detection of emergence and spread of a virulent clonal variant. ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32326712/"

Although B. melitensis is primarily associated with infection in sheep and goats, most of B. melitensis isolates in this study were obtained from secondary hosts (cattle, buffaloes, humans and a camel) suggesting cross-species adaptation of B. melitensis to large ruminants in Egypt. The MLVA-16 scheme competently discriminated 70 genotypes, with 51 genotypes represented by single isolates, and the remaining 19 genotypes were shared among 67 isolates, suggesting both sporadic and epidemiologically related characteristics of B. melitensis infection. Matching of local genotypes with representatives of global genotypes revealed that the majority of Egyptian isolates analysed had a West Mediterranean descendance. As this study represents the first comprehensive genotyping and genetic analysis of B. melitensis from different sources in Egypt, the information generated from this study will augment knowledge about the main epidemiological links associated with this bacterium and will allow a better understanding of the current epidemiological situation of brucellosis in Egypt. Ultimately, this will help to adopt effective brucellosis intervention strategies in Egypt and other developing nations. ","10.1111/tbed.13581"

Currently, whole-genome-based molecular markers, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), are the most effective tools for genotyping Bacillus anthracis. In this study, 191 isolates were selected to assess the diversity of B. anthracis in China. Five isolates were confirmed not to be B. anthracis by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat analysis, while the remaining 186 isolates were typed using canonical SNP (canSNP) and VNTR analyses. Five sublineages/subgroups, A.Br.001/002, A.Br.Vollum, A.Br.Aust.94, A.Br.Ames, and A.Br.008/009, were detected based on 13 canSNP sites. The 186 isolates were further assigned 114 sequence types based on 27 VNTR loci, with major branches correlating with the canSNP analysis. We then used a simplified multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) protocol (MLVAmin) based on eight high-resolution VNTR sites to analyze the Chinese isolates, with the resulting phylogeny again agreeing with the canSNP analysis. We also developed two schemes, MLVAc and MLVAp, using various numbers of VNTRs to analyze different canSNP sublineages to increase the typing resolution of the canSNP protocol. The results showed a highly imbalanced geographical distribution of the B. anthracis population, with four different sublineages observed in Xinjiang Province, while only one sublineage, A.Br.001/002, was found in the other six provinces, except for three A.Br.Ames strains isolated from Inner Mongolia. Based on the MLVA and canSNP analysis, the spread of B. anthracis appears to have occurred from west to east via three independent routes. ","10.1016/j.micres.2020.126414"

We evaluated the molecular types of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in pediatric patients in Taiwan in 2016. We used real-time quantitative PCR on respiratory specimens to identify M. pneumoniae in children with community-acquired pneumonia. The domain V of their 23S rRNA were sequenced for detection of macrolide-resistant point mutations. Molecular typing with multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) was done for both macrolide-susceptible and -resistance M. pneumoniae samples. M. pneumoniae was detected in 22% (180/826) respiratory samples during the study period. Among all M. pneumoniae-positive samples, 24% (43/180) had harbored macrolide-resistant genotypes, and 86% (37/43) of them were A2063G mutation. Forty-two macrolide-resistant strains and 20 randomly selected macrolide-susceptible strains underwent MLVA profiling. MLVA 4-5-7-2 was the most frequent type (32/62, 52%), followed by 4-5-7-3 (17/62, 27%) and 1-5-6-2 (9/62, 15%). There was a strong association between MLVA 4-5-7-2 and macrolide resistance (p < 0.001). In contrast, M 4-5-7-3 and 1-5-6-2 were related to macrolide susceptibility (p < 0.001, and p = 0.025, respectively). Macrolide resistance was relatively low (24%) in this age group in 2016 in Taiwan, and A2063G was the dominant point mutation. MLVA 4-5-7-2 was associated with macrolide resistance.

However, no evidence exists in literature concerning the use of this technique in treatment of peno-scrotal lymphedema. We report a case of a 44-year-old male patient who developed secondary peno-scrotal lymphedema with severe lymphorrhea, following a laser treatment for scrotal pustolosis, leading to recurrent infections and finally an established peno-scrotal lymphedema. Utilizing MLVA, a complete remission of scrotal lymphedema was achieved with significant volume reduction of the penile lymphedema. The post-operative course was uneventful with clear improvement in lymphatic flow demonstrable on lymphoscintigraphy (6 months) and no recurrence of scrotal lymphedema at 2 years follow-up. This article reports very promising results of a novel application of MLVA in the treatment of genital lymphedema and suggests that MLVA provides the possibility to shunt both superficial and deep lymphatics to improve the lymphatic drainage from the peno-scrotal area using a single surgical site.

"PubMed","Backward compatibility of whole genome sequencing data with MLVA typing using a new MLVAtype shiny application for Vibrio cholerae.","Jérôme Ambroise; Léonid M Irenge; Jean-François Durant; Bertrand Bearzatto; Godfrey Bwire; O Colin Stine; Jean-Luc Gala","Multiple-Locus Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) Analysis (MLVA) is widely used by laboratory-based surveillance networks for subtyping pathogens causing foodborne and water-borne disease outbreaks. However, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has recently emerged as the new more powerful reference for pathogen subtyping, making a data conversion method necessary which enables the users to compare the MLVA identified by either method. The MLVAType shiny application was designed to extract MLVA profiles of Vibrio cholerae isolates from WGS data while ensuring backward compatibility with traditional MLVA typing methods. To test and validate the MLVAType algorithm, WGS-derived MLVA profiles of nineteen Vibrio cholerae isolates from Democratic Republic of the Congo (n = 9) and Uganda (n = 10) were compared to MLVA profiles generated by an in silico PCR approach and Sanger sequencing, the latter being used as the reference method. Results obtained by Sanger sequencing and MLVAType were totally concordant. However, the latter were affected by censored estimations whose percentage was inversely proportional to the k-mer parameter used during genome assembly. With a k-mer of 127, less than 15% estimation of V. cholerae VNTR was censored. Preventing censored estimation was only achievable when using a longer k-mer size (i.e. 175), which is not proposed in the SPAdes v.3.13.0 software. As NGS read lengths and qualities tend to increase with time, one may expect the increase of k-mer size in a near future. Using MLVAType application with a longer k-mer size will then efficiently retrieve MLVA profiles from WGS data while avoiding censored estimation. ","10.1371/journal.pone.0225848"

Herd-level surveillance of Mycobacterium bovis genotypes (multi-locus VNTR analysis types, MLVA types) from all culture-confirmed bovine tuberculosis (TB) herd cases was undertaken in Northern Ireland (NI), generating an unparalleled, longitudinal, population-level 14-year survey for this pathogen. Across this population, 295 genetically-distinct M. bovis MLVA types were identified in the 19,717 M. bovis isolates surveyed. Of these, the most frequent was MLVA type 002 (23.0%); 151 MLVA types were represented more than once, in groups ranging from 2 to 4438 isolates. Only 23 MLVA types were isolated in all 14 years. Investigating inter-annual frequency of M. bovis MLVA types, examples of statistically-significant expansions (MLVA types 002, 004, 006, 009 and 027), contractions (MLVA types 001, 007 and 011) and maintenance (MLVA types 003 and 005) were disclosed, during a period of fluctuating bovine TB herd-level incidence at the NI scale. The fixed period frequency distribution of MLVA types remained highly right-skewed. Novel VNTR copy number variant MLVA types (N = 242; an average of 17 per annum) were identified throughout the survey. The MLVA type distribution in the landscape was not random; MLVA types showed statistically-significant geographical localization and strong spatial associations with Divisional Veterinary Office (DVO) regions. There was also evidence of differential risk of particular MLVA types across breeds (Holstein/Friesian vs. other), age-class, and sex and some evidence of an association between the number of animals testing positive for bovine TB during the disclosing test and particular MLVA types, although there was substantial variation.

"PubMed","Multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA)-typing of Brucella abortus isolates of India reveals limited genetic diversity.","Maninder Singh; Mohd Ashraf Malik; Dhirender Kumar Singh; Soni Doimari; Rohini Sharma","Multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) technique has wide applications in studying phylogenies and short-term epidemiology of pathogens. The technique has been extensively used worldwide in molecular epidemiology of Brucella genus. Only one study on this aspect is reported from India despite its economic and public health significance in country. The present study isolated B. abortus from domesticated bovines of Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir state, India, and applied MLVA for 16 loci (MLVA-16). MLVA results were compared with the results of a previous study and with MLVA data of Indian isolates present in http://microbesgenotyping.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/database. In the study, 136 samples from bovines (cattle and buffaloes) of 47 farms of Jammu region were processed for isolation. Eleven isolates of B. abortus biovar 1 from 6 farms were obtained. In MLVA-16 analysis, although the isolates were classified in a single cluster, 5 genotypes were obtained with a specific genotype being prevalent on each farm. The study identifies that MLVA-16 is capable to differentiate B. abortus strains in an area having high genetic similarity among isolates. On comparing the results with previous study and database, the isolates were found to have high genetic similarity indicating that the genetic diversity of B. abortus in India is very limited. It probably indicates that India is contaminated recently with B. abortus. To test this hypothesis, analysis of whole genome sequencing data of diverse collection of Indian B. abortus strains is required. ","10.1007/s11250-019-02110-x"
