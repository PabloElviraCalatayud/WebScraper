    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of perioperative outcomes of the KangDuo Surgical Robot System versus the Da Vinci System in robot-assisted renal surgery. We conducted a comprehensive systematic search in key databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science, encompassing studies in all languages, with the final search date being October 2025. We also excluded articles comprising reviews, letters, and single-arm studies. Variables were assessed using metrics of Weighted Mean Difference (WMD), Standardized Mean Difference (SMD), and Odds Ratio (OR). The statistical synthesis of the data, encompassing diverse outcome measures, was conducted utilizing the Review Manager software. Moreover, the protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis is publicly available on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD420251181530). In a pooled analysis of 370 participants from five trials, the KangDuo Surgical Robot System demonstrated a significantly extended docking time relative to the Da Vinci System (SMD = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.21-1.90; p < 0.00001). Conversely, comparisons of operative time, estimated blood loss, incidence of minor complications, ischemia time, and postoperative renal function (assessed by 4-week serum creatinine and eGFR) yielded comparable results, with no statistically significant differences. In this meta-analysis with limited sample size, geographic focus on Chinese centers, and short-term follow-up, the pooled data indicate that the KangDuo (KD) Surgical Robot System achieved non-inferiority to the Da Vinci System on several key perioperative metrics in robot-assisted renal surgery, although with a longer docking time. These findings support the KD system as a promising alternative in comparable settings, yet they should be interpreted within the constraints of the available evidence. Future research, particularly large-scale, multicenter randomized trials with long-term monitoring of survival and renal function, is necessary to confirm its efficacy and safety profile for widespread clinical adoption.

    "abstract": "The Hugo™ Robotic-Assisted Surgery (RAS) system is an emerging robotic platform; evidence on its performance for extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (eRARP) remains limited. Between June 2023 and September 2024, 100 patients with prostate cancer underwent eRARP using the Hugo™ RAS system. Preoperative, intraoperative, pathological and postoperative data were collected prospectively. To assess temporal trends related to platform adoption, the cohort was divided into the first 50 and last 50 cases and learning-curve dynamics were analyzed (including CUSUM for console time). We report 12-month follow-up. Across the entire series, the median operative duration was 252.5 min (Q1-Q3 200-290), with no instances of intraoperative conversion or intraoperative complications. Major postoperative events classified as Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher were observed in 2% of patients. At the 12-month assessment, an undetectable PSA (< 0.1 ng/mL) was documented in 80% of individuals, social continence (≤ 1 pad per day) in 87%, and erectile function recovery in 51%. Overall positive surgical margin (PSM) rate was 40%, with clinically significant PSM (≥ 3 mm or multifocal) of 21%. Comparison of two groups revealed a learning effect: median operative time decreased from 275 to 210 min (p < 0.00001); docking time improved modestly (p = 0.0271). Both clinically significant PSMs (28%→14%) and overall complication rates (26%→4%, p = 0.0006) declined in the second cohort. In this prospective, single-center series, eRARP using the Hugo™ RAS system was feasible and safe. A learning-curve effect produced substantially shorter operative times and fewer complications, while oncological and functional outcomes were preserved. Longer follow-up and larger multicenter studies are needed to verify long-term equivalency with well-established robotic platforms. ",

    "authors": "Mohammed Diab; Yiannis Demiris",
    "abstract": "In order to assess trust within domains necessitating Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), such as social and assistive robotics, a multifaceted cognitive infrastructure is essential to facilitate shared knowledge among the participants. This knowledge encompasses information pertaining to the behaviour, beliefs, intentions, and situational awareness of the participants, including assessments of vulnerability, reliability, and risk. The developed knowledge takes the form of a domain-agnostic ontology with multiple layers, allowing for reusability across diverse HRI tasks, and resulting in actions that can be undertaken by a participant to establish trust with the other party. This research introduces the concept of Trust-Inferring Infrastructure for Cognitive Knowledge (TICK) for domains requiring HRI, comprising three key constructs: performance, process, and purpose. Subsequently, the proposed infrastructure is evaluated through real-world scenarios involving humans as trustors and robots as trustees. To validate TICK in these real scenarios, a multimodal sensory module has been integrated into the reasoning mechanism, enhancing the robots' capabilities in understanding human intentions, perceiving the current situation, offering advice to humans, personalising their behaviour to build human trust, and evolving the robot's trustworthiness based on its performance during interactions. Trust is automatically assessed based on proximity and adherence to the robots' recommendations. Furthermore, to quantitatively assess the scalability and flexibility of the proposed approach, a series of experiments were conducted involving a kitchen domain handover task between humans and a table-top robotic arm in a lab setting, encompassing various types of objects and different scene contexts.

    "authors": "Patrick Zhong; Federico Rossi; Dylan A Shell",
    "abstract": "An important class of robotic applications involves multiple agents cooperating to provide state observations to plan joint actions. We study planning under uncertainty when more than one participant must proactively plan perception and/or communication acts, and decide whether the cost to obtain a state estimate is justified by the benefits accrued by the information thus obtained. The approach we introduce is suitable for settings where observations are of high quality and they-either alone or along with communication-recover the system's joint state, but the costs incurred mean this happens only infrequently. We formulate the problem as a type of Markov decision process (mdp) to be solved over macro-actions, sidestepping the construction of the full joint belief space, a well-known source of intractability. We then give a suitable Bellman-like recurrence that immediately suggests a means of solution. In their most general form, policies for these problems simultaneously describe (1) low-level actions to be taken, (2) stages when system-wide state is recovered, and (3) commitments to future rescheduling acts. The formulation expresses multi-agency in a variety of distinct practical forms, including: one party assisting by providing observations of, or reference points for, another; several agents communicating sensor information to fuse data and recover joint state; multiple agents coordinating activities to arrive at states that make joint state simultaneously observable to all individuals. Though solved in centralized form over joint states, the mdp is structured to allow decentralized execution, under some assumptions of synchrony in activities. After providing small-scale simulation studies of the general formulation, we discuss a specific scenario motivated by underwater gliders. We report on a physical robot implementation mocked-up to respect these same constraints, showing that joint plans are found and executed effectively by individual robots after appropriate projection. On the basis of our experience with hardware, we examine enhancements to the model that address nonidealities we have identified in practice, including the assumptions regarding synchrony. ",

    "authors": "Jong Ho Park; Hakmin Lee; Sangchul Lee; Sung Kyu Hong; Seok-Soo Byun; Jong Jin Oh",
    "abstract": "Urethro-intestinal anastomosis (UIA) leak is a critical complication of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal neobladder (ICN). Although early detubularization of ileal loop has been proposed to facilitate tension-free anastomosis, clinical evidence of its benefits in preventing UIA leaks is limited. We assessed its impact on UIA leak rates in bladder cancer patients undergoing RARC with ICN. We retrospectively identified 580 patients who underwent radical cystectomy at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between 2003-2025, of which 147 met inclusion criteria for RARC with ICN and were analyzed. We retrospectively reviewed 580 patients who underwent radical cystetomy at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between 2003-2025. Patients were grouped by detubularization timing: before (early) or after (conventional) UIA. Baseline and perioperative features were compared. Univariable analysis and multinomial logistic regression identified potential predictors of UIA leaks and evaluated the independent effect of early detubularization. Among 147 eligible patients, 93 underwent early and 54 underwent conventional detubularization. UIA leaks occurred in 6.1% (9/147), lower in the early group (2.2% vs. 13.0%, P = 0.031). Early detubularization (P = 0.031), length of hospital stay (P = 0.001), and prior abdominal surgery (P = 0.165) were potential predictors using a liberal selection threshold (P < 0.20). Multinomial regression identified early detubularization as an independent protective factor (OR, 0.154; 95% CI, 0.030-0.784; P = 0.024). Model goodness-of-fit was significant (χ² = 9.775, df = 4, P = 0.044; Nagelkerke R² = 0.096). Early detubularization appears to reduce UIA leaks following RARC with ICN. Our findings support its adoption as a technical refinement to improve anastomotic outcomes, though further prospective validation is needed. ",

    "authors": "Rashid Alyassi; Cesar Cadena; Robert Riener; Diego Paez-Granados",
    "abstract": "For autonomous mobile robots to operate effectively in human environments, navigation must extend beyond obstacle avoidance to incorporate social awareness. Safe and fluid interaction in shared spaces requires the ability to interpret human motion and adapt to social norms-an area that is being reshaped by advances in learning-based methods. This review examines recent progress in learning-based social navigation methods that deal with the complexities of human-robot coexistence. We introduce a taxonomy of navigation methods and analyze core system components, including realistic training environments and objectives that promote socially compliant behavior. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark of existing frameworks in challenging crowd scenarios, showing their advantages and shortcomings, while providing critical insights into the architectural choices that impact performance. We find that many learning-based approaches outperform model-based methods in realistic coordination scenarios such as navigating doorways. A key highlight is the end-to-end models, which achieve strong performance by directly planning from raw sensor input, enabling more efficient and adaptive navigation. This review also maps current trends and outlines ongoing challenges, offering a strategic roadmap for future research. We emphasize the need for models that accurately anticipate human movement, training environments that realistically simulate crowded spaces, and evaluation methods that capture real-world complexity. Advancing these areas will help overcome current limitations and move social navigation systems closer to safe, reliable deployment in everyday environments.

    "abstract": "Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an increasingly effective endoscopic technique worldwide. Robot-assisted ESD is a novel technique that enables complex movements by providing an extended range of motions to improve the visualization of the surgical field and provide better cosmetic surgical outcomes. We aim to systematically review and meta-analyze the efficacy and safety of robot-assisted ESD. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for meta-analysis. We included studies reporting on patients with GI tumors or masses who underwent robot-assisted ESD. Our primary outcomes were en bloc resection rates, recurrence rates, and complications like bleeding and perforation. Secondary outcomes encompassed the length of the procedure, lesion size, complete resection rates, and duration of hospital stay. We used Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tool and the ROBINS-I tool for quality assessment. Continuous data were pooled as means, while dichotomous data were pooled as proportions with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Eight studies consisting of two clinical trials, three cohort studies, and three case reports with 115 participants were included. The en bloc resection rate was 97.400%, 95% CI (0.901, 0.993). According to the complete resection outcome, the rate was 82.900%, 95% CI (0.722, 0.900). Procedure time and Hospital Stay were 82.030 min 95% CI: 48.130, 115.940), 1.640 days 95% CI (-0.180, 3.740), respectively. The intraoperative bleeding rate was 1.800%, 95% CI (0.004, 0.068). Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated robot-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection's potential efficacy and safety. However, future high-quality studies with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods are needed to support our initial findings further. Robot-assisted ESD may be promising in dealing with larger lesions, which are often challenging with conventional ESD. ",

This study compares the outcomes between Rob-H and Lap-H in a single-center setting.

    "abstract": "Partial nephrectomy (PN) is preferred treatment for localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with shift toward robotic-assisted PN (RAPN) over open PN (OPN). However, high-quality comparative data remain limited. This study aimed to compare intraoperative, perioperative, and oncologic outcomes of RAPN versus OPN using a propensity score-matched cohort. In this retrospective, single-centre study, 386 patients underwent PN between January 2020 and December 2024. After applying exclusion criteria and propensity-score matching, 152 OPN cases were matched with 125 RAPN. Matching variables included age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, RENAL and PADUA scores, cT stage, and location. Primary endpoint was the intraoperative complication rate. Secondary endpoints included estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time, warm-ischemia time, length of hospital stay (LOS), postoperative complications rate (Clavien-Dindo classification), and 5-year oncologic outcomes (overall-survival [OS], cancer-specific survival [CSS], and recurrence-free survival [RFS]). RAPN was associated with a lower intraoperative complication rate compared to OPN (2% vs. 10%, p = 0.003). RAPN resulted in lower EBL (200 mL vs. 300 mL, p = 0.001), shorter operative time (147 vs. 170 min, p = 0.001), and reduced LOS (median 6 days, p = 0.001). Postoperative complications were less frequent with RAPN (14% vs. 25%, p = 0.01), with no significant differences in severe complications or positive surgical margins. Five-year OS, CSS, and RFS were similar between groups. RAPN provides significant perioperative advantages over OPN without compromising oncologic safety at 5 years. These findings support broader adoption of RAPN in selected patients. Multicenter studies are warranted to assess cost-effectiveness, long-term functional outcomes, and generalizability. ",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a bio-inspired approach for decentralized coordination in multi-robot systems, applied to a simulated port scenario. The methodology integrates the Robot Operating System (ROS) with the Stage simulator, enabling modeling of a port environment with three autonomous robots, each capable of navigation and obstacle avoidance. The main contribution is a connectivity module inspired by Physarum polycephalum, which manages the mesh network and allows decentralized task sharing whenever connections exist. The algorithm adapts continuously to robot movement and environmental changes, ensuring efficient communication when possible and autonomous operation when disconnected. Experiments confirmed that robots relying only on local perception can form and maintain a functional network. Results showed connections established in less than two seconds on average and reconfigured almost instantly after fault, demonstrating resilience. New robots were integrated in only 0.092 seconds on average, validating scalability. A comparison between scenarios with and without communication revealed a 17.87% efficiency improvement, reducing execution time from 621 to 510 seconds thanks to dynamic load balancing. In summary, the study demonstrates the feasibility of a bio-inspired solution for decentralized coordination in multi-robot systems, capable of generating efficient, resilient, and adaptable communication networks, essential for cooperation in real-world environments.

    "abstract": "The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has enabled animals to execute movements in accordance with human intent. The rat robot represents a novel robotic system based on BCI technology. However, due to limitations in electrode fabrication techniques and the use of simplistic control strategies, current rat robots are restricted to limited movement patterns, which hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we have developed a portable wireless neural stimulator and a novel 3D integrated stimulating electrode. By refining the locomotion control strategy, we aim to achieve complex, high-degree-of-freedom movement in rat robot systems. 3D integrated electrodes were implanted into the rats' head, with no reward-based training required. By utilizing a wearable wireless stimulation backpack to connect the electrodes and deliver electrical stimulation to multiple brain regions, thereby enabling the rat to perform forward movement, turning, and stopping behaviors. The experimental results demonstrate that under optimized stimulation parameters, the forward speed of the rat robot can be controlled to achieve 31.06 ± 1.21 m/min, the turning angle can reach up to 150 ± 1.22°, and the stopping duration can be flexibly adjusted. Furthermore, we presented a practical scenario in which the rat robot successfully executed a predefined navigation task in a real-world environment, thereby validating its high degree of movement flexibility and control precision. This study achieved high-degree-of-freedom motion control of rat robots without the need for reward-based training, which was previously unattainable. This research establishes a crucial foundation and provides valuable technical references for the application of animal robots in fields such as information reconnaissance and wreckage search and rescue operations.

    "abstract": "In nature, many animals and skilled humans perform rapid, high-force maneuvers such as strikes, leaps, or escape responses, through instantaneous energy release. Replicating this synergy of speed, power, and precision in soft robots has remained an unsolved challenge. Here we introduce a combustion-driven soft actuator with an embedded backbone that, using a transient driving method, delivers millisecond-scale response, force outputs up to 70 times its self-weight, and control precision within 5%. This capability supports both static tasks (e.g., precision throwing), and dynamic actions (e.g., intercepting moving targets). Leveraging this actuator, we developed a feline-inspired robot that accelerates to eight body lengths per second and transitions to flight within 0.1 s, creating a multi-modal \"\"Jump-and-Fly Catbot\"\" (JFC) capable of jumping, flying, and hovering. JFC navigates unstructured terrains and demonstrates robust escape capabilities, including freeing itself from bed entrapment, avoiding obstructing branches, and evading net capture, with response within 0.5 s, that surpass current soft robotic systems. These results establish a new paradigm for soft robots, integrating high-force interaction, precision control, and versatile locomotion for robust operation in complex environments. ",

This study aimed to explore a method for preventing rhabdomyolysis and WLCS, focusing on external pressure on the lower leg during surgery. Three hundred patients who underwent RARP performed in the steep Trendelenburg position with a 25-degree head-down tilt between June 2018 and June 2022 were examined. The patients were divided into pressure-controlled and non-pressure-controlled groups. In the pressure-controlled group, external pressure on the lower leg was measured using the Portable Interface Pressure Sensor (Palm Q®) while creating the surgical position. The patient was placed in the required surgical position ensuring that external pressure on the lower leg was maintained below 20 mmHg. In the non-pressure-controlled group, external pressure on the lower leg was not measured. Postoperative outcomes, including creatine kinase (CK) levels and incidence of rhabdomyolysis and WLCS were compared. CK levels on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 2 were significantly lower in the pressure-controlled group (median: 342 and 352 IU/L, respectively) than in the non-pressure-controlled group (837 and 708 IU/L, respectively) (P < 0.05 for both comparisons). The incidence of rhabdomyolysis was lower in the pressure-controlled group, and no cases of WLCS were observed, in contrast to two cases identified in the non-pressure-controlled group. Maintaining external pressure on the lower legs below 20 mmHg during RARP may contribute to preventing rhabdomyolysis and WLCS after RARP. This method can be applicable to other surgeries performed in the Trendelenburg position. ",

    "abstract": "Anterior clinoidectomy and optic canal (OC) unroofing are highly specific neurosurgical techniques, and crucial for addressing complex pathologies of the central skull base. Current approaches using high-speed drills and manual piece-meal resection require sophisticated surgical skills and pose the risk of mechanical and thermal damage. Laser bone cutting demonstrates superior precision and improved bone healing compared with traditional mechanical methods. This study presents preclinical cadaveric experiments to investigate the feasibility of robot-guided cold ablation laser osteotomy for anterior clinoid excavation and OC delineation, supported by a systematic review of the literature. Four fresh-frozen human skulls were used. Access to the target structures was achieved via pterional craniotomy and extradural preparation. A robot-guided erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser (Er:YAG laser) was used for the excavation of the anterior clinoid process (ACP) and OC delineation. Safety and accuracy were maintained by optical coherence tomography, a navigation system, and a coaxial camera. The bone ablations were visually analyzed intraoperatively, postoperatively by computed tomography scans, and microscopically after skull maceration. Four ACPs were excavated and 4 OCs were delineated with the Er:YAG laser. On average, 63% of the spongious bone of the ACP was removed. The cutting edges of the excavation and the delineation were sharply defined and correspond to the planned trajectories of the preoperative planning. Cortical perforation was observed in 2 specimens. Restricted literature data emphasize the need for further investigation into in vivo laser osteotomies, especially for orbitocranial surgery. This preclinical study demonstrates the feasibility of robot-guided Er:YAG laser removal of osseous tissue at the skull base after preoperative computer-assisted planning. This technique may provide significant advantages in skull base surgery with a high degree of cutting precision. Further research is needed to refine preoperative planning, workflow, and safety aspects. ",

This prospective study evaluates the safety and efficacy of robot-assisted tailored neurectomy, leveraging 3D visualization for precision. Ten consecutive patients (mean age: 46 years; 80% male) with refractory neuropathic groin pain (≥6 months) were enrolled at a university single-center (January-July 2024). Inclusion required preoperative nerve mapping, imaging (CT, MRI, and sonography) to exclude nonneuropathic causes, and failure of conservative measures (nerve blocks and analgesics). Exclusion criteria included ASA class ≥4, nonneuropathic pain, or prior triple neurectomy. Robot-assisted retroperitoneal neurectomy was performed by selectively resecting nerves (IIN, IHN, and GFN) ± mesh removal based on intraoperative findings. All procedures were completed robotically (mean operative time: 60 minutes, SD: 10.1; no conversions). Mean preoperative pain scores (numeric rating scale) decreased significantly from 7.8 to 1.2 at 180 days (P < 0.001). Opioids and neuropathic medications were discontinued in 90% of patients. Transient deafferentation (hypersensitivity) resolved within 6 weeks in 80% of cases, while 2 patients reported residual but diminishing symptoms. At 10-month follow-up, all patients reported improved daily function with no recurrences. Mean and median hospitalization was 1 day. Robot-assisted tailored neurectomy is a safe and effective treatment for refractory CPIP, offering precise nerve resection, minimal morbidity, and rapid recovery. The 85% reduction in pain scores and 90% opioid cessation rate align with literature success rates (85-97%). This approach overcomes limitations of open/laparoscopic techniques through enhanced visualization and adaptability. Larger studies are warranted to validate long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "Concentric-tube robots (CTRs) have garnered significant attention in various minimally invasive procedures due to their small size and dexterity. Despite extensive technical advancements in the development of CTRs, there is a lack of design approaches specific to their function as surgical instruments. This study proposes a compact CTR specifically designed for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), adaptable for both hand-held operation and mounting on a passive arm. We employ a parallel carriage-based design to reduce the device's cross-sectional footprint (46 mm diameter, 322 mm length) and localize the center of mass (570 g mass) beneath the grip area, enhancing ergonomic comfort and control. An ergonomic evaluation of the robot during the handling of the robot by expert urologists, as well as non-clinicians, showed better ergonomics than standard hand-held PCNL devices. Additionally, closed-loop position control of the distal end of the CTR was implemented based on resolved-motion rate inverse kinematics. The performance of the robot was empirically validated through experiments on a life-size abdominal phantom. The results showed mean closed-loop position errors of 1.2±0.8 mm for autonomous navigation to 100 target points on the stone, indicating a performance level in line with the specific requirements of PCNL.

    "abstract": "Kidney cancer incidence continues to rise globally, with partial nephrectomy established as the standard of care for localized renal masses. Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy has become the preferred approach, with debate continuing regarding the optimal management of renal blood flow during tumor excision. While on-clamp techniques involve temporary renal artery occlusion to minimize blood loss, off-clamp approaches avoid ischemic injury by maintaining continuous renal perfusion. This meta-analysis aimed to compare perioperative, functional, and oncological outcomes between off-clamp and on-clamp robot-assisted partial nephrectomy. A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. Twenty studies, comprising two randomized controlled trials and 18 observational studies, were included, totaling 4,961 patients after matching. Quality assessment utilized the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomized trials. Meta-analysis employed risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous variables, with random-effects models applied when heterogeneity exceeded 50%. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Off-clamp robot-assisted partial nephrectomy demonstrated significantly lower major complication rates compared to on-clamp techniques (RR: 1.66, p = 0.018). Renal function preservation favored the off-clamp approach, with better postoperative glomerular filtration rate (MD: -3.45 mL/min/1.73 m2, p < 0.0001). The on-clamp technique showed less estimated blood loss (MD: -32.7 mL, p < 0.0001), though this did not translate to differences in transfusion requirements (RR: 0.80, p = 0.208). Operative time was longer for off-clamp procedures (MD: 21.55 minutes, p = 0.030). Hospital stay duration did not differ significantly between techniques (MD: 0.02 days, p = 0.946). Subgroup analysis by follow-up duration revealed that renal function benefits were most pronounced at intermediate (three to nine months) and long-term (≥12 months) follow-up. Our study concluded that off-clamp robot-assisted partial nephrectomy offers superior safety, with significantly reduced major complications and better preservation of renal function, particularly at intermediate and long-term follow-up, despite requiring longer operative time. Both techniques demonstrate equivalent oncological efficacy with comparable positive surgical margins. The off-clamp approach should be preferred for patients at high risk of ischemic injury. At the same time, technique selection should be individualized based on patient renal reserve, tumor complexity, and surgical expertise. ",

    "abstract": "The integration of advanced technologies is transforming surgical practice, particularly through robotic systems. This study presents the early clinical implementation of the Dexter® surgical robot for cholecystectomy and evaluates clinical outcomes using the IDEAL framework. Twenty patients underwent elective robotic-assisted cholecystectomy using the Dexter® robot. A thorough implementation process, including rigorous surgeon and nurse training and standardized care protocols, was established. Data on operative metrics, complications, and patient outcomes were analyzed, and patient well-being was assessed via a postoperative phone survey. Six surgeons and thirty nurses were trained, with surgeons completing a minimum of 20 h of simulation. Preoperative and operative times were significantly reduced through this process. Comparing the first 10 operations to the second, docking time decreased from 11.4 ± 4.1 min to 7.1 ± 2.1 min (p=0.0144) and operative time improved from 130.5 ± 25.7 min to 99.7 ± 21.8 min (p=0.0134). Mean intraoperative blood loss was minimal, averaging 19.5 ± 31.4 mL, and the average length of hospital stay was 3.1 ± 1.4 days. Postoperative pain levels were low, and patient satisfaction was high, as assessed by telephone survey. Our findings highlight the value of the IDEAL framework in guiding the systematic evaluation and implementation of new surgical technologies such as the Dexter® robot. A structured approach is essential to improve patient outcomes and safety in the coming digital transformation of surgery. ",

Clinical characteristics, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and surgical outcomes were reviewed. Operative time was defined as the time from skin incision to closure. Multivariate linear regression analyses stratified by surgical method were performed to identify factors influencing operative time. Operative time was significantly longer in the RALH than in the TLH group (median:208 vs. 176 min, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that uterine length (LU) was associated with longer operative time in both groups, whereas parity was associated with reduced operative time in the RALH group. Both UL and parity were independent factors influencing operative time and highlighted the clinical implications of longer operative time in early-phase RALH compared with TLH. ",

This study focuses on identifying digital biomarkers emerging during robotic and virtual reality (VR)-based diagnostics and rehabilitation. It presents findings from a systematic review conducted within the activities of Spoke 9 (Advanced Gerontechnologies for Active and Healthy Ageing) of the Age-It Research Program. A literature review examined studies on digital biomarkers in relation to the technologies of interest, focusing on aging, up to March 25, 2025. Four hundred seventy-one English-written papers were retrieved; after screening, 19 studies were included. We summarized them considering the application domain, identifying the corresponding digital biomarkers, the target users, and the technology used. For cognitive assessment, digital biomarkers are used to monitor patient behaviors during clinical tasks that use VR-based technologies and social robots. In VR-based cognitive rehabilitation scenarios, digital biomarkers are used to assess the performance of task accomplishment. In the physical activity monitoring domain, gait-related parameters are assessed by social robots, while thermal cameras are used for thermodynamic analyses. In the physical rehabilitation domain, digital biomarkers related to the upper-body motions are usually considered. Despite promising results, several improvements are needed. Robotic solutions offer versatility in terms of applications but have low readiness. Similarly, thermodynamic models require strict conditions for reliability. Virtual reality-based cognitive assessment lacks temporal data for better discrimination, and VR-based cognitive rehabilitation is limited by a lack of multimodal stimulation. Future research should address these limitations effectively. ",

    "abstract": "The use of social robots in therapy for children with autism has been explored for more than 20 years, but there still is limited clinical evidence. The work presented here provides a systematic approach to evaluating both efficacy and effectiveness, bridging the gap between theory and practice by targeting joint attention, imitation, and turn-taking as core developmental mechanisms that can make a difference in autism interventions. We present two randomized clinical trials with different robot-assisted therapy implementations aimed at young children. The first is an efficacy trial (n = 69; mean age = 4.4 years) showing that 12 biweekly sessions of in-clinic robot-assisted therapy achieve equivalent outcomes to conventional treatment but with a significant increase in the patients' engagement. The second trial (n = 63; mean age = 5.9 years) evaluates the effectiveness in real-world settings by substituting the clinical setup with a simpler one for use in schools or homes. Over the course of a modest dosage of five sessions, we show equivalent outcomes to standard treatment. Both efficacy and effectiveness trials lend further credibility to the beneficial role that social robots can play in autism therapy while also highlighting the potential advantages of portable and cost-effective setups.

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Post-stroke spasticity limits motor recovery and independence. Combining botulinum toxin type-A (BoNT-A) injection with intensive, task-specific robot-assisted therapy (RAT) might enhance neuroplasticity and functional gains, but its additive effect and optimal timing are uncertain. (2) Methods: We systematically searched major medical databases and trial registries up to April 2025 for randomized controlled trials in adults with post-stroke spasticity comparing botulinum toxin type-A injection plus RAT with toxin injection plus conventional therapy, or RAT alone with RAT combined with toxin injection. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool, and findings were synthesized narratively. (3) Results: Seven trials (n = 229) were included. Across all studies, toxin treatment reduced spasticity within groups, whereas additional spasticity reduction with RAT versus conventional rehabilitation was inconsistent. In contrast, several lower-limb trials reported greater improvements in walking capacity and balance when RAT was added, while upper-limb trials showed comparable motor recovery across treatment arms with occasional advantages in strength and movement quality. A pilot four-arm study suggested that starting RAT around four weeks after injection may maximize upper-limb motor gains. (4) Conclusions: The combination of BoNT-A with RAT appears safe and is particularly promising for gait rehabilitation, but further research is needed to define optimal timing and protocols. ",

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: To determine the optimal site preparation and placement protocols for immediate implant positioning in robot-assisted surgeries. Methods: In vitro models of immediate and healed extraction sockets were created using 3D printing. A robotic system was used for implant site preparation and implant placement. The implant surgeries were allocated into eight experimental groups using 12 printed models in total. Each model incorporated two implant sites, an immediate site (tooth 21) and a healed site (tooth 26), resulting in 24 implants overall. With 3 implants assigned to each group, the 24 implant placements were evenly distributed across the 8 groups. For each group, the lateral force experienced during surgery was recorded by the haptic sensor on the robotic arm, and implant positional deviations were assessed by superimposing post-surgical CBCT images with the virtual implant planning. Results: Healed sites showed significantly higher accuracy than immediate sites, with reduced platform and apical deviations (p < 0.001) and markedly lower lateral force experienced by drills. In fully guided procedures, thread tapping greatly improved accuracy in immediate sites but had limited benefit in healed sites. Compared with partially guided workflows, fully guided rCAIS markedly enhanced accuracy in immediate sites (≈0.8 mm reduction in platform/apical deviation, p < 0.001), while no meaningful differences were observed in healed sites. Fully guided protocols also reduced insertion force in healed sites. Conclusions: Immediate sites showed lower implant positional accuracy and experienced higher lateral forces during surgery than healed sites. In immediate sites, thread tapping and fully guided rCAIS improved placement accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, robots have started to be used in tasks involving human interaction. For this to be possible, humans must perceive robots as suitable interaction partners. This can be achieved by giving the robots an animate appearance. One of the methods that can be utilised to endow a robot with a lively appearance is giving it the ability to perform expressions on its own, that is, combining multimodal actions to convey information. However, this can become a challenge if the robot has to use gestures and speech simultaneously, as the non-verbal actions need to support the message communicated by the verbal component. In this manuscript, we present a system that, based on a robot's utterances, predicts the corresponding gesture and synchronises it with the speech. A deep learning-based prediction model labels the robot's speech with the types of expressions that should accompany it. Then, a rule-based synchronisation module connects different gestures to the correct parts of the speech. For this, we have tested two different approaches: (i) using a combination of recurrent neural networks and conditional random fields; and (ii) using transformer models. The results show that the proposed system can properly select co-speech gestures under the time constraints imposed by real-world interactions. ",

    "abstract": "Current upper-limb rehabilitation robots primarily focus on training tasks involving free movements or static interactions with rigid objects. These paradigms lack simulation of complex object manipulation tasks encountered in daily life, thereby limiting the training of patients' high-level sensorimotor integration capabilities. To address this gap, this study proposes an innovative robotic rehabilitation training system designed for functional occupational therapy. Specifically, the task of transporting a water cup was abstracted into a cup-ball system integrated with a robotic arm. The ball was modeled as a point mass, and kinematic and dynamic analyses of the system were conducted. A visual tracking method was employed to monitor the ball's motion and calculate its slosh angle. Owing to the impaired fine motor control in stroke patients, a sloshing suppression control strategy integrating exponential filtering, feedforward force compensation, and impedance control was proposed to prevent the ball from spilling. Experiments validated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicated that with full compensation, the oscillation rate of the ball was significantly reduced, and the smoothness of the hand force was markedly improved. This study presents an effective method for addressing dynamic uncertainty in rehabilitation robot training, thus significantly improving the functional relevance of the training. ",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the kinematic performance of two shoulder rehabilitation exoskeleton configurations to address the critical challenge of human-robot compatibility. Utilizing Hunt's mobility formula and task-specific Jacobian analysis, we developed a closed-chain kinematic model integrating transient glenohumeral joint dynamics, validated through force/torque measurements and ANOVA statistical comparisons. The PPRRRP configuration, featuring orthogonally distributed passive prismatic joints, demonstrated superior performance: 40-60% lower interaction forces (F¯total=2.66 N), near-isotropic manipulability (ellipsoid axis ratio < 1.5), and 60% reduced operational torque (T¯total=0.18 N·m) compared to RRRUP's universal joint design. These results establish passive DOF optimization as a viable alternative to actuator-dense systems, diverging from conventional approaches like ARMin-III that prioritize active control. The originality lies in bridging theoretical configuration synthesis with empirical validation, offering a replicable framework for compatibility assessment. This work advances rehabilitation robotics by demonstrating that mechanical transparency-achieved through strategic passive joint allocation-enhances natural movement synergy without compromising stability, proposing hypotheses on energy efficiency and isotropy-fatigue correlations for future exploration. Clinical translation and adaptive impedance control integration are identified as critical next steps to optimize patient-specific rehabilitation outcomes. ",

The study included thirty-two dental students, divided into two phases, which were further randomized into two groups: Group A and Group B. During the initial phase, no motivational methods were applied to both the groups. In the second phase, Group A received audiovisual education, while Group B utilized the OHR. Clinical parameters (gingival index and plaque index) for both the groups were recorded before oral prophylaxis (at day 0) and subsequently at the completion of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 8th weeks. The findings revealed that both the methods of motivation significantly improved plaque control compared to the absence of motivational tools. However, students who interacted with the OHR demonstrated superior results in maintaining oral hygiene as the mean gingival index reduced from 1.661 ± 0.404 to 0.836 ± 0.349 (P < 0.001) and the mean plaque index reduced from 3.203 ± 0.338 to 1.582 ± 0.283 (P < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Air pollution is one of the major environmental issues in Iran, driven by industrial greenhouse gas emissions, vehicle exhaust, power plants, and natural sources such as dust storms. Among various pollutants, PM₂.₅ is especially concerning due to its high prevalence in urban areas. Governments have utilized air quality monitoring stations to measure PM₂.₅ concentration levels to implement policies aimed at controlling this pollutant. Fixed monitoring stations, which operate for regulatory purposes, are typically located in urban areas where a large portion of the population resides. However, the measurements obtained from these stations are limited due to their insufficient number, uneven distribution, and inadequate spatial coverage, which prevent continuous pollutant estimation over large areas and the generation of comprehensive risk maps. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel hybrid modeling framework for modeling the spatiotemporal distribution of PM₂.₅ across Iran. The proposed approach integrates Cellular Automata with the XGBoost algorithm, leveraging both satellite-based products and ground observations. Within this framework, XGBoost generates continuous transition potentials for each neighborhood window, enabling dynamic representation of spatial variations in PM₂.₅ levels. The resulting model achieved an adjusted R² of 0.88, demonstrating strong performance in capturing regional and temporal variability. A key strength of the method is its ability to localize the influence of predictor variables across different regions, allowing the development of region-specific models within each neighborhood window and improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy.

Baseline and endpoint assessments included the Fugl-Meyer lower extremity (FMA-LE) motor function assessment, functional ambulation category (FAC) scale, Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and electroencephalogram. After a 3-week intervention period, participants in both groups showed significant improvements in FMA-LE, FAC, and BBS scores compared to baseline levels. The EA combined RAGT group exhibited a reduction in the brain symmetry index within the alpha frequency band, along with enhanced coherence between the CZ electrode and the FCZ, FC2, and C1 electrodes. Furthermore, in the theta frequency band, a shortened average path length and improved global efficiency were observed. Both interventions can safely and effectively improve lower limb motor function, and EA combined with RAGT combination therapy may have an advantage in promoting neuroplasticity, which may involve reversing pathological frequency spectrum imbalance after stroke, enhancing functional connections between sensorimotor-related brain regions, and optimizing the topological properties of brain functional networks.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a real-time distributed framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms operating in GPS-denied indoor environments, built on the Aerial Robot Cognitive Network Architecture (ARCog-NET) cognitive architecture and enhanced with monocular visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). ARCog-NET employs a multi-layered Edge-Fog-Cloud (EFC) hierarchy that supports decentralized decision-making and adaptive coordination, including dynamic path optimization. Through a novel formulation, each UAV jointly estimates its own trajectory and contributes to a shared 3D reconstruction of the environment by exchanging matched visual landmarks across the network. The system dynamically adapts navigation paths in response to operational events using reinforcement learning guided by trajectory coverage metrics and historical decision weights. A full deployment with six DJI Ryze Tello UAVs was conducted in a controlled indoor lab environment, demonstrating autonomous swarm navigation and collaborative 3D mapping. Performance was evaluated through metrics such as trajectory error, point cloud fidelity, decision convergence, and knowledge reuse rate. Results confirm that the proposed method enables scalable, autonomous SLAM and planning capabilities in real-world UAV networks, highlighting the cognitive synergy between navigation and perception in distributed aerial robotics.

    "abstract": "Mediastinoscopic esophagectomy (ME) is a minimally invasive surgery for esophageal cancer that avoids one-lung ventilation and chest wall trauma. However, a major challenge with this technique is the relatively high incidence of left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RLNP). To address this, we introduced a transcervical mediastinoscopic and transabdominal robot-assisted esophagectomy (RA-ME) technique. The clinical significance of robotic assistance in ME was evaluated by comparing RA-ME and conventional ME (Co-ME), using propensity score matching (PSM) to control for baseline characteristics. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent ME for esophageal or esophagogastric junction cancer between April 2018 and March 2025. Patients were classified into RA-ME and Co-ME groups. PSM was performed using five covariates, resulting in 68 matched pairs (n = 136). The primary endpoint was the incidence of left RLNP, whereas secondary endpoints included operative time, blood loss, complications, lymph node yield, and R0 resection rate. A total of 136 matched patients (RA-ME, n = 68; Co-ME, n = 68) were analyzed after PSM. The RA-ME group had a significantly lower RLNP incidence (19.1% vs 38.2%, p = 0.022) and less intraoperative blood loss than the Co-ME group (99.8 ± 116.1 mL vs 251.0 ± 821.1 mL, p = 0.001). Operative time, complication rates, lymph node yield, and R0 resection rates were comparable between the groups. RA-ME significantly reduced RLNP incidence, nearly halving it, and lowered intraoperative blood loss without compromising oncologic quality. These findings support the potential use of RA-ME as a standard approach in select cases of minimally invasive esophageal cancer surgery. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the surgical characteristics of da Vinci robotic and endoscopic-assisted thyroidectomy and compare the clinical outcomes of da Vinci robotic and endoscopic-assisted gasless unilateral transaxillary approach for thyroid surgery. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent da Vinci robotic or endoscopic-assisted thyroidectomyat the Head and Neck Surgery Department of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between July 2020 and June 2024, with follow-up until December 2024. Data on clinicopathological characteristics, operative time, hospitalization costs, surgical complications, and postoperative incision satisfaction were collected and analyzed. Results: During the study period, a total of 618 da Vinci robot-assisted thyroid surgeries and 239 endoscope-assisted thyroid surgeries were performed. In terms of surgical approach, both the robot group and the endoscope group mainly used the unilateral axillary gasless approach: 598 cases (96.8%) in the robotic group and 161 cases (67.4%) in the endoscopic group. The proportion of patients undergoing extended surgical procedures, such as unilateral lobectomy plus ipsilateral central neck dissection (level Ⅵ) and lateral neck dissection, was higher in the robotic group than in the endoscopic group [8.9% (53/598) vs 0.6% (1/161), P<.001]. Regarding the scope of surgery, both groups mainly performed unilateral thyroid lobectomy with ipsilateral level Ⅵ lymph node dissection: 543 cases (87.9%) in the robotic group and 218 cases (91.2%) in the endoscopic group. For patients undergoing unilateral thyroid lobectomy with level Ⅵ lymph node dissection, there were 531 cases in the robotic group [average age (35.4±9.1) years, 92 male] and 154 cases in the endoscopic group [average age (34.5±9.0) years, 13 male]. The robotic group had higher proportions of males [17.3% (92/531) vs 8.4% (13/154)], higher BMI [(22.8±3.6) vs (21.8±3.0) kg/m2], larger tumor diameters [(7.2±3.6) vs (6.5±2.8) mm], higher total costs [(5.5±0.5) vs (2.5±0.7) ten thousand yuan], and more level Ⅵ lymph nodes removed [(3.1±2.3) vs (2.0±1.4)] than the endoscopic group (all P<0.05). The robotic group's surgeries were shorter [(87.4±35.3) vs (127.1±40.2) min], and they had a lower incidence of temporary postoperative hoarseness [1.13% (6/531) vs 3.89% (6/154)] compared to the endoscopic group (both P<0.05). There was no significant difference in postoperative scar satisfaction between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: The gasless unilateral transaxillary approach and unilateral lobectomy plus ipsilateral central neck dissection (level Ⅵ) are the most common surgical approach and extent for da Vinci robotic and endoscopic-assisted thyroidectomy, respectively. Da Vinci robotic surgery is more frequently applied in male patients, higher BMI, larger tumors, and more extensive resections, and it offers superior recurrent laryngeal nerve protection compared to endoscopic systems. However, health economic factors must be considered in practical applications. ",
